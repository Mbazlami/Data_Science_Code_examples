# Data_Science_Projects
A brief overview of the coding capabilities in the area of machine learning  

# [Forest fire prediction regression problem](https://github.com/Mbazlami/forest-fire-prediction-)
- Exploratory data anlayis on forest fire data for Montisenho park
- Standaridize data to accomodate features that are heavily weighted by their units
- Grid Search through models to obtain the best predicting model

# [Wine classification problem](https://github.com/Mbazlami/Wine-Classification)
- Explore relationship between attributes and develop a good understanding of what will be a good predictor for the type of wine.
- Performing Variance filtering to obtain best predictors using a variance threshold.
- Grid Search through machine learning models such as KNN, SVC, logistic regression, and many others and returning the best performing model.

# Predicting Explosiviblity of chemical dusts.
- Dimensionality problem where varaibles are larger than the data points.
